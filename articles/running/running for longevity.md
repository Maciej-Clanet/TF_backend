In the age of fitness fads and quick-fix solutions, there's one activity that has stood the test of time: running. And who better to take advice from than the boomers who've been pounding the pavement for decades? Let's dive into the wisdom they have to offer about running for longevity

### 1. Start Slow and Steady
Remember the tale of the tortoise and the hare? Well, in this race, Biden and Trump are both tortoises. Starting slow and building up your stamina is the key. As the saying goes, "It's not a sprint; it's a marathon." Or in their case, a presidential race that never ends!

### 2. Consistency is Key
It's not about how fast you run but how long you keep running. Our boomer buddies might not be setting world records, but they've been consistent. Whether it's running for office or running on the track, consistency pays off in the long run.

### 3. Listen to Your Body
As we age, our bodies might not be as forgiving as they once were. It's essential to listen to those aches and pains. If Biden's knee is acting up or Trump's heel spur is flaring, it's time to take a break. Remember, it's about longevity, not pushing yourself to the limit every time.

### 4. Stay Hydrated
Water is the elixir of life. Whether you're delivering a speech or running a 5k, staying hydrated is crucial. And no, diet sodas and tanning lotions don't count!

### 5. Enjoy the Journey
Running is as much a mental game as it is a physical one. Enjoy the scenery, the people you meet along the way, and the sheer joy of movement. After all, as Trump might say, "Running is tremendous!" And Biden? "It's just a big deal!"

### 6. Invest in Good Shoes
Your feet carry you through life, so treat them well. Whether you're stepping onto Air Force One or the local running track, a good pair of shoes can make all the difference. And who knows, maybe they'll even help you "step up" in the polls!

### Conclusion
Running for longevity is more than just a physical activity; it's a lifestyle choice. By following the sage advice of our boomer runners, we can all hope to be in the race for the long haul. And remember, it's never too late to start. After all, if Biden and Trump can race in a marathon, so can you!
